            <p>
                To apple, Steve Jobs is a role model who my children revere in near-hero status. His vision and spirit will live forever. He will be missed in the flesh but will forever be a presence in our world. May peace and happy reflection of Mr. Jobs be in all of us foreword.

            <p>
                To Steve's famly and friends. I did not know this gentleman but he has changed my life with his visions. My sincerest condolences go out to you all. Many Thanks
                I just got my first computer at 38 yrs old last Halloween. I wanted to get a quality computer and always heard that Apple was the top of the line. After a year working with it, I understand just what people meant by it being the best. I just want to say thanks because it is opening up doors that I didn't know existed in the most positive ways. Anything is possible is an understatement.

               Steve inspired me. As someone who grew up using Macs, I was always keenly aware of the difference passion, humanism, and art make in any endeavor. He poured all of these into his products, and showed the world that success and human values go hand in hand. He will always be my hero.
